##Project Name: Full-Stack Notes Sharing Application
##Overview
This project is a Full-Stack Notes Sharing Application built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js (Express) for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. The application allows users to share notes, create accounts, and manage their content efficiently.

#Tech Stack
Frontend:
React.js: For building the user interface.
CSS Modules/Bootstrap: For styling the components.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
Backend:
Node.js (Express): For building RESTful API endpoints.
MongoDB: For storing user data and notes.
Mongoose: To interact with MongoDB easily.
JWT (JSON Web Token): For authentication and secure access to certain endpoints.
Features
User Authentication: Signup/Login using JWT for secure access.
Notes Sharing: Users can upload, share, and manage their notes.
Responsive UI: The app is responsive and user-friendly.
Data Storage: MongoDB to store user profiles and notes.
RESTful API: Backend API to manage user requests like create, read, update, and delete notes.
